✋ Dino Jump with Hand Gestures
🖐️ Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe

✊ Gesture detection to simulate spacebar for jumping

🎮 Hands-free gameplay for the Chrome Dino game

🎥 Displays live webcam feed with bounding box & landmarks

🏃‍♂️ Dynamic jump status display ("Jump" or "No Jump")

🎯 Simple threshold-based pinch gesture for action triggering

🚀 Getting Started for those who want to use my repo

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DinoHandGestureGame.git
cd DinoHandGestureGame
2. Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
3. Run the game controller
python dino_hand_control.py
Make sure your webcam is working, and the Chrome Dino game is open in the browser!

🧠 Educational Focus
This project demonstrates how computer vision and hand landmarks can be applied for gesture-controlled automation:

🧲 Pinch detection → using thumb + index finger distance

📷 Real-time landmark tracking → via MediaPipe Hands

🎮 Controlling games/apps → using pyautogui + vision

📁 Project Structure
